This site is the blog for [Mass Mesh](https://massmesh.org). We are a Boston-based group of developers convinced that there's a better way to administer internet infrastructure. We believe that the internet is a magnificent resource that must be held in common in order to achieve freedom in our society. To this end, we are working with various community partners to install mesh networks in our area.

## Our Mission

We believe strongly in the importance of closing the digital divide, and practice design justice in order to achieve this. There are no technocratic solutions here! Rather, there is technology co-created with the people it serves.

We work in close partnership with Ujima Boston on their community-owned internet initiative, and that relationship was incubated in partnership with the MIT Media Lab. These partnerships have been absolutely vital to our growth.

## Get Involved

If you would like to get involved in our project, there are a lot of ways to do so!
