This site is the blog for [Mass Mesh](https://massmesh.org). We are a Boston-based group of developers convinced that there's a better way to administer internet infrastructure. We believe that the internet is a magnificent resource that must be held in common in order to achieve freedom in our society. To this end, we are working with various community partners to install mesh networks in our area.
